## Introduction 
This is an operating systems project that focuses on CPU scheduling. The CPU Scheduling Simulator implemets basic scheduling algoritms such as First-Come-First-Serve(FCFS), Shortest Job First(SJF), 
Round Robin, and Priority scheduling using java with a simple but usefull GUI using java swing.

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit(JDK)8
- A Java compiler or an IDE
- No external libraries needed

## How to run 
1. Clone the repo:
   ```
   https://github.com/incizen/CPU-Scheduling-Simulator.git
   ```

2. Open the terminal and run: 

```sh
javac *.java
java Design
```

And thats pretty much it! 
Now you can pick one of the scheduling algoritms, type in the preffered process arrival time, burst time and priority. Add as many processes as you want and run the simulator.
